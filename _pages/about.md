I am a Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. <a href='https://bse.carnegiescience.edu/dr-ken-caldeira-emeritus'>Ken Caldeira</a>
 and Dr. <a href='https://www.ess.uci.edu/~sjdavis/'>Steven J. Davis</a>
 at <a href='https://bse.carnegiescience.edu/dr-shi-chen'>Carnegie Science Center</a>. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from and conducted postdoctoral research in the <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/enven/'>School of Environment</a>
 at Tsinghua University.


In confronting the critical issues of climate change and the drive towards net-zero emissions, my work is at the forefront of crafting innovative strategies for navigating the complexities of achieving a sustainable future. To this end, my research integrates multiple sources of data and establishes a universally applicable assessment methodology, catering to the analysis requirements of multiple temporal and spatial scales and various application scenarios. Within a unified framework, it comprehensively considers the interrelationships and feedback mechanisms among technological, economic, and environmental indicators, thus enhancing the precision of solar energy temporal and spatial assessments.
